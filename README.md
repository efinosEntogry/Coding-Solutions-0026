Array based problem

Write a function that returns the index of the largest element
in an array of integers. If there are more such elements than
one, return the largest index. If the size is equal or less than 0,
return -1. Use the following header:
int indexOfLargestElement(double array[], int size)
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter 15 numbers,
invokes this function to return the index of the largest element,
and displays the index.
